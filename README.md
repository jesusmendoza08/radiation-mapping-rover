# Radiation Mapping Rover​



*The “Radiation Mapping Rover” is a multifunctional exploration platform designed for efficient and reliable radiation detection and mapping in terrestrial environments. The system integrates a Geiger tube sensor for radiation measurement, GPS technology for geospatial mapping, and a camera for visual navigation. It also features a servo-driven robotic arm for object collection and manipulation. The rover is remotely controlled via a cellular device through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity, enabling real-time monitoring and data acquisition. This project encompasses the interdisciplinary integration of hardware design, control theory, software development, and system engineering, reflecting core principles of both electrical and computer engineering. Through optimized power management and the use of cost-effective components, the Radiation Mapping Rover achieves durability and reliability for radiation data collection across diverse terrain and environmental conditions.*

### Design Concept

*The “Radiation Mapping Rover” project aims to design and implement a compact, mobile platform capable of detecting, mapping, and reporting radiation levels in real time while minimizing risk to human operators. The primary objectives are as follows: remote radiation detection, manual mobility, mapping/localization, sample collection, camera, power efficiency management, control system design, mechanical design, and wireless communication via WiFi/Bluetooth.*

* Its primary purpose is to detect, map, and analyze
radiation levels in real time, providing valuable data
for environmental monitoring, research, and
emergency response.​
* Rover can be deployed in situations such as laboratory
spills, industrial accidents, nuclear facility
inspections, or post-disaster assessments, where
entering the area manually would be dangerous
* Project aims to fill a market gap for a compact,
affordable, and customizable radiation detection rover
suitable for universities, research labs, and small-scale
safety operations.​
* We will focus only on testing and mapping ionizing
radiation from radioactive isotopes — not
electromagnetic radiation like light, RF, or
microwaves.​

## Hardware Design


- Employ custom DC–DC buck converters to distribute stable voltages (5 V / 6 V) to motors, servos, and electronics with >85 % efficiency, minimizing battery drain on an 11.1 V Li-Po power source.

- Mechanical design constraints - Ensure a total rover weight below 5 lb (including sensors, camera, and arm), with compact chassis dimensions of approximately 7.48 × 10.83 × 3.54 inches to support lightweight mobility and portability. 
- Achieve reliable operation through proper electrical isolation between high-current motor drivers (H-bridges) and low-power control circuitry (microcontroller, sensors).
